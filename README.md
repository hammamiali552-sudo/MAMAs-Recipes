# 🥘 HeritageKitchen: Authentic Culinary Logistics Platform

**A centralized web platform bridging the gap between cultural heritage and home dining through a managed culinary supply chain.**

## 📖 Project Overview
HeritageKitchen is a full-stack web application designed to reconnect individuals living in the USA with the authentic tastes of their home culture. Unlike standard food delivery apps that rely on commercial restaurants, this platform operationalizes a unique "farm-to-cook-to-table" model.

The application handles complex logistics: processing user orders, sourcing specific authentic ingredients, shipping those ingredients to vetted home cooks, and facilitating the delivery of the prepared meal to the customer.

## 💡 The Solution
Many expatriates and cultural enthusiasts in the US lack access to the specific ingredients or the time required to recreate the "taste of home."
* **The Concept:** We don't just deliver food; we supply the *authenticity*.
* **The Execution:** By centrally sourcing ingredients and shipping them to specialized cooks, we ensure that the final dish maintains cultural accuracy before it reaches the customer.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The application logic manages a three-step supply chain:
1.  **Order & Sourcing:** The customer selects a cultural dish. The system identifies necessary authentic ingredients from inventory.
2.  **Cook Dispatch:** Ingredients are shipped to a "Specialist Cook"—a vetted home chef with expertise in that specific cuisine.
3.  **Preparation & Fulfillment:** The cook prepares the meal, and the system coordinates a courier to deliver the hot, fresh food to the customer.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Cuisine-Centric Marketplace:** Users can browse meals by culture, region, or specific nostalgic dishes.
* **Logistics Algorithm:** Backend logic to track the status of ingredients moving to cooks, and meals moving to customers.
* **Cook Matching System:** Automatically pairs orders with available cooks based on specialty (e.g., pairing a Peruvian Lomo Saltado order with a Peruvian specialist).
* **User Roles:** Distinct interfaces for **Customers** (ordering), **Cooks** (receiving tasks/ingredients), and **Admins** (supply chain oversight).

## 🛠 Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Backend Framework:** Django / Flask (Select one)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Future Improvements
* Integration with third-party shipping APIs (FedEx/UPS) for real-time tracking.
* Review and rating system for Cooks.
* Subscription model for weekly cultural meals.
